Installation and configuration
==============================


Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This chapter describes how to install, configure and uninstall the EnergyPlusToFMU tools.


Software requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To export an EnergyPlus simulation as an FMU, EnergyPlusToFMU needs:

1. Python 2.6 or higher.

2. A C compiler and linker.

3. A C++ compiler and linker.

EnergyPlusToFMU has been tested on:

- Linux Ubuntu 12.04.

- Windows XP Professional.

- Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the EnergyPlusToFMU package:

1. Download the installation file (EnergyPlusToFMU-1.0.zip) from the download page.

2. Unzip the installation file into any folder (hereafter referred to as the "intallation directory").

Minimally, the installation directory should contain the following subdirectories:

- ``Scripts``

  - ``EnergyPlusToFMU``
    (Python scripts that create an FMU from an IDF file)

    - ``script-dos``
      (batch files specific to Windows)

    - ``script-linux``
      (shell scripts specific to Linux)

    - ``script-macos``
      (shell scripts specific to Mac OS X)

- ``SourceCode``
  (C and C++ source code for creating an EnergyPlus FMU)


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EnergyPlusToFMU requires a C compiler and linker (in order to build the FMU), and a C++ compiler and linker (in order to build some supporting tools).

In order to run the compiler and linker, EnergyPlusToFMU uses the following batch files:

+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Batch file           | Purpose                                               |
+======================+=======================================================+
| ``compile-c.bat``    | Compiles a C source code file into an object file.    |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``link-c-exe.bat``   | Links object files generated by a C compiler,         |
|                      | into an executable (i.e., a stand-alone application). |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``link-c-lib.bat``   | Links object files generated by a C compiler,         |
|                      | into a shared library.                                |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``compile-cpp.bat``  | Compiles a C++ source code file into an object file.  |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``link-cpp-exe.bat`` | Links object files generated by a C++ compiler,       |
|                      | into an executable (i.e. a stand-alone application).  |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

The contents of these batch files depends on the operating system, the compiler and linker (e.g., gcc versus Microsoft), and the options desired (e.g., a 32-bit or 64-bit FMU).
Therefore the configuration step involves selecting and modifying these files, according to your particular needs.

The EnergyPlusToFMU installation includes some sample batch files.
These cover some common cases.
However, configuring EnergyPlusToFMU for your system may require changing one of more of the provided batch files.

First, identify the appropriate subdirectory where these batch files reside.
As shown above, the ``Scripts/EnergyPlusToFMU`` directory contains a subdirectory for each of the supported platforms.

Note that the Python runtime detects your platform.
That means if you are running Python on an emulator or virtual machine (for example, Cygwin in Windows, or using Parallels on a Mac), you should look in the subdirectory corresponding to the emulated operating system.


Uninstallation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To uninstall EnergyPlusToFMU, simply delete the installation directory where it was unzipped.
