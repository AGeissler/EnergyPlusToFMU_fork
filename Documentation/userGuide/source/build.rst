Creating an FMU
===============

This chapter describes how to build a Functional Mockup Unit, starting from an EnergyPlus IDF file.
It assumes you have already followed the :doc:`installation` instructions, and that you have already created an IDF file following the :doc:`bestPractice` guidelines.

To build an FMU, open a command window (e.g., a DOS prompt on Windows, a command shell on Linux, or a Terminal window on MacOS).
The instructions that follow represent the command window like this:

.. code-block:: none

  # This is a comment.
  > (This is the command prompt, where you enter a command)
  (If shown, this is sample output in response to the command)

Note that your system may use a different symbol than "``>``" as the command prompt (for example, "``$``").
Furthermore, the prompt may include information such as the name of your system, or the name of the current subdirectory.
