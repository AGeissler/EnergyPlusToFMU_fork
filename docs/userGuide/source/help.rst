Before submitting a bug report, 
 * check (fixme: update link) https://corbu.lbl.gov/trac/bie/report/1 if the bug is already known, and
 * make sure that it is a bug of the FMU implementation and not a bug of the EnergyPlus model. EnergyPlus bugs should be isolated so that they do not require use of an FMU, and then sent to the EnergyPlus help desk at http://energyplus.helpserve.com/
 
When submitting a bug report, please provide:
 * A model that is as small as possible and still reproduces your error. The chances of quickly finding and fixing a bug are much higher if the bug is part of a small test problem. In addition, creating a small test problem may help finding the root cause for the bug yourself, or realizing that there is no bug at all, and hence your problem can be solved much sooner.
 * A description of the expected and the observed results.
 * Information about the operating system and the EnergyPlus version.

To report the bug, send email to (fixme: update link) https://groups.google.com/group/modelica-buildings. This is an open group and everyone can join it. No invitation is needed.
