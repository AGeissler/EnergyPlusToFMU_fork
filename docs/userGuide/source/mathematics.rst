Mathematical Description
========================

fixme: Explain when variables are updated in E+.

Note: In FMU, :math:`x(t_i)` is the value of :math:`x(\cdot)` for
:math:`t \in [t_i, \, t_{i+1})`, but in EnergyPlus, I believe 
that discrete variables are not yet updated when the data are exchanged.
